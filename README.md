## How to get started

> You can start by entering a user name and the room you want to join

> User name is something that will be displayed to other users when you send a message. Its the display name

> Room is something where you can join. It can be any name as long as all of your friends are in the same room you all can chat. For example if you're the first one to initiate the chat then you can specify the room anything(lets say "bangalorian"). Then you can invite your friends to join the same room(in this case "bangalorian") and once you all are in the same room, you all can start chatting

## Rules for choosing username and room

-  You can choose anything as username and room as long as it is not used by another person

-  Remember the username and room both are not case sensitive

-  Than means "bangalorean" , "Bangalorean", and "BANGALOREAN" are all same
